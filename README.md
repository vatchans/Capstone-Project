I have developed a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application for Milky Dairy Farm's website. This application has three user roles: Customer, Admin, and Customer Executive.

Admin:
The Admin has a dashboard where they can manage all customer orders, as well as create, modify, and delete products. In order to access the Admin dashboard, correct login credentials are required to ensure security. Admins do not have access to sign up.

Here's the link to the Admin Dashboard: https://venerable-marigold-437243.netlify.app/AdminDashboard

Admin Credentials: Email: Admin@gmail.com, Password: Admin@123

Customer:
The Customer has access to view products, add products to their basket, buy products, and subscribe. Before initiating a purchase, customers must log in. They also have the ability to register complaints about products and payment-related issues. To ensure secure payment, Razorpay has been integrated.

Customer Executive:
The Customer Executive has a dashboard where they can view all customer complaints. They can review the complaint reason and accept the query. Once the query has been accepted, it will be assigned to the Customer Executive, and the complaint will go through three different stages: Pending, Processing, and Resolved. For each stage, the customer will be notified through email. Once the query has been assigned to the Customer Executive, it will be in the Processing state. After connecting with the customer, they can resolve the complaint by providing a proper solution to their issue. This way, we can scale up our business by providing good customer support and building good relationships with them.

I hope this helps you better understand about this CRM application.
